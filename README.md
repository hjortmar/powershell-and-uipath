# Running Powershell scripts with UiPath

Hello!

This project is meant to demonstrate how you can get UiPath to run Powershell scripts reliably.

When I started developing things with the help of UiPath I struggled getting Powershell to behave properly when using scripts from within a UiPath project, it is simply clunky to deal with through UiPath and you do not have full autonamy of the behaviour as it runs through the context of UiPath. 

###The downside###
Logging through UiPath, it will not know that you are running a script with the exception that it waits for the script to complete.

###The upside###
Powershell has a very established community meaning you can do more, more is good.
