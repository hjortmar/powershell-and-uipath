# Running Powershell scripts with UiPath

Hello!

This project is meant to demonstrate how you can get UiPath to run Powershell scripts.

You have probably read other guides for this purpose but it is simply clunky to deal with through UiPath and it is run through the context of UiPath which I did recognize to be reliable. It might have been my fault, I just felt that the flexibility is not there.. atleast not yet.
 
Being the lazy person that I am.. instead of creating a long story in UiPath for something that would be 5-10 lines in a script, I had to scratch that itch.

### Con ###
Logging, UiPath will not know that you are running a script with the exception that it waits for the script to complete so you want to make that give you a confirmation and/or add lines to the logs by other means.

### Pro ###
There is a tremendous amount of modules and scripts made by other smarter people than atleast myself so you can do big IQ stuff with your robots with the help of their efforts and ofcourse a massive community. A huge pro in my book.
